"""
This is the pipeline for producing torque data and analyzing it.

The basic pipeline proceeds as follows:
    1. Data is generated by moco_script_torque_endpoint.py
        This returns two folders with several torques and paths.
    2. Data is passed into and organized by organizeCSV.py
        This returns a csv with merged torque and kinematic data.
    3. The csv is passed into makeDataFromCSV.py   
        This returns the activity of the neural network.
    4. Take this end result over to MATLAB.
